    <p><b>Ahem. We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a message from the web developer.</b></p>
    <p>A lot of confessions have been coming in about the NOCAT or about cell bio, given the recent assessment we had. I just wanted to say, please be kind to yourselves. It's all going to be alright. Things might seem glum, or things might be going great. Either way, both good times and bad times come to an end. I would suggest being stoic about both circumstances. And, if you want to watch something entertaining, I would suggest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxGRhd_iWuE">this</a>.</p>
    <p><i>You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, and loved more than you know.</i></p>
